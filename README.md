# Project-US

As a part of a project to assess lung ability to breath, diaphragm ultrasound scans were processed. Two different ways have been utilised to localise the diaphragm region. First a lineDetection algorithm was developed which based on convolution (mexican hat filter) and bright pixels selection, detects the diaphragm upper and lower lines. On the contrary, a pearsian correlation test was used to perform the similar task. Both of them were provided to the project team.
Project was completed in python script.
